## Spotify recently played tracks
Spotify doesn't actually offer a way to view your recently played tracks so I have made a way for you!

This piece of code will take a username (mine atm) and check for the songs that were played on the pervious day and add them to a SQLite database each time you run main.py.

The code requres a spotify API token for you account which can be found online. Simply change the limit of songs to 50 and collect the token. 
(Do all this in main.py)

Enjoy:)
